# Go Six

This was an experimental helper library for building idiomatic (to Go and 6RS) cloud
services. The experiment is over and it has been replaced by Uber's Fx library.

The empty module is left to force migrations away from it to complete. The git
history is left behind to assist that and for any interested spelunkers.
